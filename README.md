MC CRW Sampler
==============

This program is used to perform Monte Carlo sampling of two molecules
in vacuo for CRW coarse-grained force field parametrizations.

Getting Started
===============

Make sure you have Gromacs 4.6 sourced in your path and run:

# bash compile.bash

This should compile the code and give you an executable named mc_crw.
Then take your input and preprocess it using grompp and execute the program
to run the simulation.

For more details have a look at the HOWTO file.

Citing

If you use this code or the CRW method in general for your CG parametrization
